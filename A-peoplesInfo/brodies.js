You are able to make 'Pures' that store money for a specific purpose like pay for rent. You do this till all of your money is separated. Then you simply update the amount in a purse as money comes and goes. I built this using React.js and Express with all custom CSS.",

When you hover over them they change to a random color. The biggest challenge here was getting the hovering effect. I solved this by taking the coordinates from my mouse and in a way made an invisible box with the mouse in the center of it. Then I took all of the coordinates from ever pixel that made that box and checked to see if there was a dot inside it. If there was I would change the color of the dot.",

In this project, every time the page refreshes it is the programmes job to fill the screen horizontally with randomly sized rectangles. The biggest challenge here was getting the squares to not overlap or touch each other. To solve this I took all the coordinates on the x-axis and store them. Every time I want it to create a rectangle I would have it randomly define all of the dimensions for it and randomly decide where it wants to place it. Then I would pretend to place it using the coordinates from the x-axis I stored and check to see if there was room for it. If there was I would place it on the screen and remove the coordinates that it took up in the x-axis from the collection of coordinates I stored.",
